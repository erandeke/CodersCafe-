Foumula for calculating AP
:
https://byjus.com/maths/arithmetic-progression/

an = a + (n − 1) × d

nth term of AP:
an = a+(n-1)d
where a is the first term n is the nth term  d is the common difference
exmple find the nth term = 15 of the sequence 1,2,3,4,5....an

an = 1 + (15-1) 1
   =14


*** Sum of AP for n terms

S = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]

**** Sum of AP when last term is known

S= n/2(first term + last term)
