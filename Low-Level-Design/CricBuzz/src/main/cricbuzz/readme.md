**Problem:**
Write a cricket scorecard that will show the score for a team along with score of each player.
You will be given the number of players in each team, the number of overs and their batting
order as input. Then, we can input overs ball by ball with the runs scored on that ball (could be
wide, no ball or a wicket as well).



You are expected to print individual scores, number of balls faced, number of 4s, number of 6s
for all the players from the batting side at the end of every over. You also need to print total
score, total wickets. Essentially, you need to keep a track of all the players, strike changes (at
the end of the over or after taking singles or 3s) and maintain their scores, also keep track of
extra bowls that are being bowled (like wides or no balls). You also need to print which team
won the match at the end.
