Here is the small client for bloomfilters 

Usecase :
It reads the usernames from the words.txt file and go through 4 hash functions.
Post which its hashed into bitSet array

So,by now all the usernames are hashed and placed in bitSet array 

Now, when user tries to enter new username then our system will check 
if that username is present or already taken by giving the desired response
